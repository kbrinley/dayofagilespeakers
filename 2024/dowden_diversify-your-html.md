# `div`ersify your HTML

by Martine Dowden

Since the inception of the web, HTML has been one of the cornerstones of web development, but how well do we know and understand it? Each element not only has default styles provided by the browser, but also semantic meaning which helps us with code structure, maintainability, SEO and, Accessibility. We regularly use divs, spans, buttons, paragraph tags and many more, but what about the ones that arenâ€™t so common like `<time>` or `<abbr>`? In this talk we will go over some lesser known HTML elements that can help us create better content for our users.
